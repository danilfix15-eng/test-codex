# Secure LMS Architecture Blueprint

Static site describing the technology plan for a secure and modern Learning Management System tailored for premium course delivery.

## Local development

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Start a local static file server from the project root:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to explore the site.

The homepage (`index.html`) outlines the architecture, database schema, API endpoints, and security strategy. Styles and interactions are defined in `styles.css` and `script.js` respectively.
